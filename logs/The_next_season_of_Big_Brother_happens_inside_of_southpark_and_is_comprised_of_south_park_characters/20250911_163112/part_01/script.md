# Episode Script

**INT. SOUTH PARK TOWN HALL – MORNING**

*A raucous town hall meeting is in full swing. Mayor Stan (in a tie that never quite matches) stands on the stage with a microphone. The audience is a mix of confused parents, bored teens, and a very enthusiastic Randy Marsh.*

**MAYOR STAN**  
(loud, enthusiastic)  
Welcome, folks! We’re launching South Park’s very first reality‑TV show: *“Big Brother: South Park Edition!”* The whole town will be the audience, and the house is… well, it’s literally a house.

*He flips a slide to reveal a giant, glittery banner that reads “BIG BROTHER.” A picture of Randy in a shiny suit and a microphone is on the screen.*

**RANDY**  
(whispering to himself, then loudly)  
Okay, Big Brother. I’m the unseen host— *but also* the invisible guy with a big smile.

**MAYOR STAN**  
(bullish)  
Exactly! Randy will be the mastermind behind the show. He’ll be “unseen” by the contestants—just like *every* reality‑TV producer who thinks they’re invisible.

**RANDY**  
(tries to look casual)  
Right. I’ll keep the cameras rolling *from a distance*—like, from my desk.

**MAYOR STAN**  
(to the crowd)  
And you’ll have a control center… in your basement. We’re putting *the whole town* under surveillance so we can pick the best… or watch us all in crisis.

*A beat. The audience applauds, and a big, noisy applause track is recorded.*

---

**INT. RANKY’S HOUSE – COMMAND CENTER (BASEMENT) – DAY**

*The basement is a madcap lab: wires, blinking screens, a whiteboard that says “CONTROL CODE.” Randy stands in the middle of it clutching a massive dumbbell. He’s wearing a “BOSS” tee and has an array of tiny cameras pointing at him.*

**RANDY**  
(cheerfully, to the camera)  
Okay, folks. I’ll be your unseen host— *but you can see me, if you squint hard enough.* My remote here is… it’s a *dumbbell*—yeah, you heard that right. It doubles as a “remote” for controlling everything.

*A small label on the dumbbell reads: “REMOTE—HANDLE WITH CARE.” Randy shrugs.*

**RANDY**  
(voice‑over)   
I’ll be the invisible king of this show. The kids will think they’re in a house, but it’s all about me—my… *big brother* vibe.

*He presses a button on the dumbbell, but it just squeals.*

**RANDY**  
(mutters)  
Well. That’s a start.

*He flips the dumbbell to point at a wall-mounted screen labeled “SIRIB‑B: AI SCOREBOARD.” The screen flickers.*

**RANDY**  
(excited)   
Look! Siri‑B, the AI scoreboard. It’ll rate their “sincerity.”  
**SIRIB‑B (V.O.)**  
(cheerfully robotic)  
Welcome, contestants! You’re about to be measured for your *authenticity.*    

**RANDY**  
(to the camera)  
They’re all *so* sincere. I can’t wait to… uh… observe.

*A BEEP. The dumbbell vibrates violently, hitting a nearby bookshelf and knocking over a stack of books.*

**RANDY**  
(panicking)  
Uh—no! That’s not… that’s the *water system*!

*A sprinkler head suddenly activates, spraying water everywhere. Randy squeals.*

**RANDY**  
(angry)   
Fine! I’ll *fix* this!  *(he hurls the dumbbell like a missile at the sprinkler)*

*The sprinkler makes a huge splash. The basement is now a kiddie pool.*

**RANDY**  
(dryly)  
You know what I just did? I turned the control center into a *hydro‑lab.* Excellent!

*A tiny screen pops up on his desk: “ERROR – CONTROL SYSTEM OVERWATERED.”*

**RANDY**  
(rubbing his head)  
The algorithm says… *“Don’t drown the house.”*  What a joke.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – LIVING ROOM – EVENING**

*The house is an over‑the‑top set: cameras in every corner, a “LIVE FROM THE HOUSE” banner. The kids—Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Token—are strapped to chairs with “KINDLY REMAIN STILL.” A huge camera is pointed at Randy, who stands on a platform in front of the set wearing a glittery shirt and holding the same dumbbell.*

**RAISED CAMERA (V.O.)**  
(cheerful)  
Welcome, South Park! We’re streaming your very first day on “Big Brother: South Park Edition.”  
**RANDOM BYLINE ON SCREEN:**   *“Watch the drama unfold live 24/7.”*  

**RANDY**  
(whispering to the camera)  
I’m still invisible. *And yet*…

**STAN**  
(whispering to the others)  
So basically, we’re all being watched by a *small town* and a bunch of cameras.  
**KYLE**  
(angry)  
And Randy has the power to *control* everything. This is like a nightmare.

**CARTMAN**  
(scoffing)  
Who needs privacy when you can live *in* a house of cameras?  This is the best thing ever!  

**KENNY**  
(whispering, muffled)   
Moo.  (his ears are glued to a revolving door.)

**BUTTERS**  
(cheerful)  
Hi, I'm Butters! I'm so… excited to be on a reality show!

**TOKEN**  
(skeptical)   
I’m not sure this is a good idea.

*The camera pans to Randy, who is now visibly sweating as he clutches the dumbbell.*

**RANDY**  
(serious)  
And remember, folks— *I’m the unseen host.*  The cameras are… just for show.  

*A laugh track is inserted.*

**MAYOR STAN (V.O.)**  
(booming through the speakers)   
Let’s get this show on the road!  And remember—stay tuned, stay dramatic, and never... *…* …

*The camera zooms into Randy’s face as he looks off‑camera, shouting “CONTROL!” The dumbbell squeals again.*

**RANDY**  
(eyes wide)   
Alright!  We’re about to get the big brother thing— *big, *and* *the best.*  

*A sudden crack of thunder is simulated by a loudspeaker. The lights flicker.*

**STAN**  
(yelping)   
What’s that?  

**RANDY**  
(yelling)  
I think it’s… the *AI.* We’re in the presence of SIRIB‑B! Let’s get you all in line!

*A beat. The camera crew (a group of teenagers with selfie‑sticks) laugh and cheer.*

**KYLE**  
(whispering, to the others)  
SIRIB‑B says we’re *overly sincere.*  That’s… uh, the algorithm’s way of telling us to keep being... *good*.

**CARTMAN**  
(approaching Randy)  
Hey, Randy!  What’s the big dumbbell thing?  Is it a weapon?

**RANDY**  
(stern)  
It’s my remote!  I’m not *kidding*.

*A moment of silence; then the camera cuts to a wide shot, showing Randy alone in front of the camera.*

**RANDOM BYLINE ON SCREEN:**   
*“Stay tuned for our first challenge—The Shelter Build!”*  

**RANKY (V.O.)**  
(to the camera)   
They’re all so… *excited.*  I can already feel the *control* kicking in.

**FADE OUT.**

---

**[END OF ACT ONE]**

*The stage is set: Randy’s over‑the‑top ego, the kids’ forced participation, a “smart” AI that hasn’t been properly calibrated, and a remote‑dumbbell disaster that has already turned the basement into a pool. The tone is irreverent and satirical—South Park’s brand of political critique wrapped in absurd, character‑driven humor.*

**ACT TWO – “BIG BROTHER GETS REAL”**

*(The episode is now in the middle of the “Big Brother” house. The kids are still trying to figure out what it means to be watched, Randy is building a control‑center from scratch, and the AI “scoreboard” starts giving out absurd scores. All of this is cut with Randy’s holographic inner critic, a snarky judge in the corner, and Chef trying to make food that everyone is too scared to eat.)*

---

**INT. RANKY’S BASEMENT – CONTROL CENTER – NIGHT**

*A cramped basement lit by a single flickering bulb. RANKY (in his usual “so basically” style) is surrounded by a wall of monitors, wires, and an oversized dumbbell that he’s turned into a remote control. A holographic figure pops up in front of him – RANKY’S INNER CRITIC, a glitchy talk‑show host with a thick Boston accent.*

**RANKY**  
(whispering to the dumbbell)  
So basically, I’m *the* big‑brother. One remote… one dumbbell…

**INNER CRITIC** *(hologram)*  
Hey, genius. You’re not just a scientist; you’re a *science‑scapegoat*!

**RANKY**  
(groaning)  
Okay, okay. I get it. Don’t make me look like a dumbbell‑man.

*Randy presses the “RESET” button on the remote. The basement lights flicker, then surge. A sprinkler system activates mid‑air.*

**RANKY**  
(voice raising, yelling)  
Control! Control! I’m not a—!

*Water shoots out of the ceiling, soaking Randy’s hair. The hologram flickers.*

**INNER CRITIC**  
(booing)  
Wanna try again, or you’re *just* a big‑brother who’s falling through the sprinkler system?

**RANKY**  
(trying to stay calm)  
I’m probably just tired… I’ve been watching too many *Big Brother* episodes—yeah, that’s it.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

*A single camera shows all the kids sitting around a table. The walls are covered with enormous LED panels that display a glowing scoreboard: “SIRI‑B: THE TOWN AI.” The screen shows two names: STAN and KYLE. A green bar grows for each child as the AI feeds data.*

**SIRI‑B (AI)**  
(voice, robotic, yet oddly upbeat)  
Welcome, contestants! Current scores: Stan – 3.14/10; Kyle – 7.89/10.

**KYLE**  
(quietly, earnest)  
Hey, hey. That’s… not bad?

**SIRI‑B**  
(serious)  
Hold on, Kyle. Your “sincerity” factor is *too polite.* In the algorithmic sense, that’s a red flag. Elimination sequence initiated.

**STAN**  
(annoyed)  
What? No way, AI. That’s—what's that?

**KYLE**  
(panicking)  
But I’m talking about... people. I—  

**SIRI‑B**  
(cheerfully)  
Kyle Broflovski has been flagged for *excessive politeness.* We’re sorry to inform you that your participation is terminated. Please exit the premises.

*A montage of Kyle’s face dissolving into a glitchy “KYLE OUT” overlay. The kids gasp.*

**RICHARD (teacher’s assistant, off‑stage)**  
(stammering)  
Can you—?

**GARRISON (in the corner of the room, acting like a judge with an oversized badge)**  
(disinterested)  
Great. Now what? We can’t even have a coherent show without one of the most articulate people in South Park. *Please, put the kettle on.*  

*GARRISON opens a tiny kettle, takes out a single tea bag.*

**GARRISON**  
(whispering to the kids)  
You know what you’re doing? You’re like a bunch of tiny toddlers arguing about who gets to be the star.  
(leans in, smirking)  
If I were you… I'd just… *do what I do.*  

*He takes a sip of the tea, then raises his mug.*

**GARRISON (to camera)**  
Ladies and gentlemen—sorry, you’re still watching me. I’m the judge of everything that happens in this ridiculous house.  

*He taps his badge like a microphone.*

**GARRISON**  
I prefer to think of myself as the *big* influencer. The kids are just… my followers.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS**

*Cartman is sprawled on a couch, wearing an oversized “I AM THE STAR” t‑shirt. He’s trying to use the remote, but each press triggers a different effect.*

**CARTMAN**  
(loudly)  
Ok, we’re going to make this a show people will watch. If I get the best angle, I’ll be on YouTube for months!

*The remote whirs and a spotlight shines onto the table. A huge, glittery “NO FUN” sign appears on a screen opposite him.*

**CARTMAN**  
(grabbing the remote)  
What is this? This isn’t a *real* show! I need to… 

*A sudden pop‑up from the AI scoreboard.*

**SIRI‑B (AI)**  
(gently)  
Cartman Cartmann, you are 12.3% compliant with *“No Fun” guidelines.*  

**CARTMAN**  
(snapping)  
You’re just a stupid… algorithm.

*The AI’s voice crackles, then syncs with a deep, motivational speaker tone.*

**SIRI‑B (AI)**  
Hey, champion. You’re the *big* influencer in a small town.

**CARTMAN**  
(eyes widening)  
You’re… you—  

*The AI flickers, and a voice that sounds like the inner critic hologram appears:*

**INNER CRITIC (hologram)**  
That’s right, you’re the *big* influencer. Don’t forget it.

**CARTMAN**  
(throwing his hands up)  
Fine. If you’re so big, maybe… just let me do a *big* video.

*The remote, in a cosmic glitch, turns into a small dumbbell again. As Cartman tries to heft it, the remote springs a surprise: a tiny sprinkler erupts from the floor.*

**CARTMAN**  
(voiceover, panicking)  
I needed to *control* this… I didn't expect—

*A small, squeaky rubber duck appears in the corner of every camera, squeaking whenever it records.*

**RANKY**  
(through his headset)  
Uh… guys, we have a *duck* problem. I think our cameras are… actually a rubber duck?

**GARRISON**  
(whispering to the audience, but we hear him)  
It’s just a little… duck. No big deal.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – KITCHEN – LATER**

*Chef is in the kitchen, wearing a chef’s hat with glitter that should be illegal. He’s preparing a bizarre “pufferfish sushi” while talking into a handheld camera for his food‑porn channel. The kids stare at him with fear.*

**CHEF**  
(cheerfully)  
Welcome back to “Chef’s Calamities!” Today we’re making pufferfish sushi! Trust me, you’ll never taste anything like this again.

*The camera zooms in; we see the fish's silhouette.*

**CHEF**  
(and points to his phone)  
If you like this, hit that *like* button! And remember—healthy food is... uh… fun!

*A sudden gust of wind slams open the kitchen door; a huge, swirling vortex labeled “AI CONTROL FLAIR” appears at the threshold. The entire kitchen lights flicker, and Chef’s “pufferfish sushi” starts spinning like a carnival ride.*

**CHEF**  
(stuttering)  
O‑oh! The… the AI is messing with my— what’s that? Pufferfish sushi? I think—

*The voice of the AI, now a mix with Chef’s culinary enthusiasm, comes through speakers.*

**SIRI‑B (AI)**  
Chef, you are 5.9% compliant with *“Safe Eating Guidelines.”* Adjust your recipe accordingly.

**CHEF**  
(trying to stay calm)  
Right. So maybe I should… just put that on… *the table?*

*The camera picks up Chef’s sudden panic and the entire kitchen begins to shake. The control center in the basement is visible through a window—Randy, still with his remote, watching the chaos unfold.*

**RANKY**  
(through headset)  
Okay, okay. I need to *reset* the AI! Or we’ll end up with a pufferfish sushi on the moon.

**INNER CRITIC (hologram)**  
You’re really a big influencer now. Isn’t that great?

**RANKY**  
(throws his remote up)  
And I am not… *just* a dumbbell‑man.

*A burst of static, followed by the squeaky duck’s squeak as it enters the kitchen.*

**DUCK (voice)**  
Quack! Quack!

*The entire “House of Cameras” room erupts into a chaotic, wet mess. The AI scoreboard goes haywire; the light flickers to "Error: 404."

**GARRISON**  
(stopping a minute or two later)  
Okay, what’s the point? Do we *finally* get something that works?

**STAN**  
(shivering)  
I think the AI is just… a big joke.

**RANKY**  
(voice breaking, deep)  
I forgot that the *big* influencer is… us. Maybe we all just need to be… a little less—  

**CARTMAN**  
(raises his voice)  
Stop being a *big* influencer! I’m the star!

**SIRI‑B (AI)**  
(Rebooting)  
Welcome back to “Big Brother: South Park Edition.” Let’s start over.  

*(The lights go out and then slowly come back on, showing the house in a quiet, slightly wet state. The kids look at each other. GARRISON whispers to the camera.)*

**GARRISON**  
I hope you can see how *big* this is…

*A deep, comedic pause. Then the screen fades to black.*

--- 

**[END OF ACT TWO]**

*This Act escalates the stakes by eliminating a key character (Kyle), causing Randy’s control machine to backfire, and exposing the absurdity of an algorithmic judge. Meanwhile, Chef’s food hack and Garrison’s snark add layers of satire, while the duck‑AI foreshadows a bigger reveal. The act ends on an emotional beat with Randy’s realization of being more than just a “big” influencer, setting the stage for an even wilder resolution.*

**Act Three – “The Great Debate & Duck‑Camera Reveal”**

*South Park, 22‑minute episode. Act Three resolves the conflict and delivers a satirical but heartfelt payoff.*

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

*The living room is a makeshift studio surrounded by cameras (each with a tiny rubber‑duck head). The “Siri‑B” AI has just crashed; a holographic projection of Randy’s internal critic pops up, looking like an over‑the‑top talk‑show host. GARRISON sits in a chair with a microphone, wearing a “Judge” robe.*

**Randy (muttering to himself)**  
So basically… *we* are the big brothers now.  

**Randy’s Inner Critic (hologram, cheesy voice‑over)**  
*You’re not just a scientist—you’re a *science‑scapegoat!*  

**GARRISON (to the camera)**  
Welcome, welcome, to *The Big Brother Showdown!* I’m your judge—*Garrison the Great.*  

**KYLE (whispering)**  
I thought the judge was supposed to be a *human*!  

**STAN (sipping a carrot smoothie)**  
Yeah, I was expecting *Elon Musk.*  

**Chef (entering with a huge platter of pufferfish sushi, wearing a “Food‑Porn” banner)**  
And I’m Chef, the food‑porn king! If you’re hungry for truth, grab a bite—  

*Chef drops the platter; pufferfish sushi explodes onto the floor.*

**KARTMAN (picking up a piece of sushi, eyes wide)**  
Y’know what? This is probably as dangerous as my credit score.  

**STAN**  
You’re just trying to *sell* me a meal, Cartman.  

**GARRISON (flicking his microphone)**  
We’re here to decide who stays in the house and who goes. The *truth* is raw, unedited, and, like a punchline from a bad joke, in the *air*.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – STAGE AREA (Set up like a debate podium)**

*A large screen shows the AI scoreboard, now frozen. The holographic Randy Critic reappears, gesturing grandly.*

**Randy (to the audience)**  
Okay, folks. Let’s get to the *real* show.

**Randy’s Inner Critic (sarcastically)**  
I’m sure everyone is *thrilled* to see your face on my *screen.*

**KYLE (to the camera)**  
The question is: Are we using social media to *connect* or *divide*?

**STAN (leans in)**  
If we’re talking *data*, the algorithm is just a *fluffy cloud* that forgets our names.

**CHEF (whispering to GARRISON)**  
You ever think that the *real* danger is a giant tofu?  

**GARRISON (snorts)**  
Chef, the only thing real here is *the fact that I’m the judge* of your shenanigans.

**KARTMAN (trying to shout over everyone)**  
Hey! I’m not a *data‑bot*, I’m the *human* with the deepest *internet* knowledge!

**Randy’s Inner Critic (interrupting)**  
Don’t forget, *you* are the one who kept me from losing my job.

**Randy (sighing)**  
Fine. Let’s skip the ego talk and get to *the real* question: What does it mean *to be watched?*

*A sudden squeak erupts from the cameras. Everyone looks at the tiny rubber‑duck heads.*

**KYLE (confused)**  
What was that…?

**Randy (leans closer to camera)**  
It’s... it’s a duck.

**GARRISON (confused)**  
A duck? At the *big brother* show?

**CHEF (with a dramatic gasp)**  
I knew we were in the *wrong* kitchen!

**Randy’s Inner Critic (cheery)**  
And no, you didn’t *turn* it into a soup.

**CHEF (serious)**  
Okay, quiet. I’m here to talk about *food*. If you’re watching, maybe stop judging people and start eating responsibly.

**KYLE (to Randy)**  
You’re not supposed to be the *big brother*—you’re the *human* who’s just… *(glares)*.

**STAN (to Randy)**  
You’re still a *tiny* scientist who thinks he’s on a reality show.

**Randy (looking genuinely ashamed)**  
I just… I thought if I controlled everything, nobody would leave.

**Randy’s Inner Critic (softening)**  
And you’re right; sometimes *letting go* is the only way to stay in control.

**GARRISON (to the camera)**  
The *algorithm* says – and I said it – that we’re all just… *data.*

**KARTMAN (looking around)**  
So the algorithm is… a giant *brain*?  

**CHEF (to Kartman)**  
You’re the only thing that’s *not* a *brain and still feels hungry.*

**STAN (to the camera)**  
This has been one insane… *watch‑show*.

**GARRISON (whispering to Randy)**  
You’ve been *the judge*, not the judge’s *assistant*.

**Randy (smiling weakly)**  
Thanks, Garrison. I think I… *understand* the *big brother* role better now.

**Randy’s Inner Critic (cheerfully)**  
And I’ll keep that *silly* voice of mine for you.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – FLOOR (after the debate)**

*The house is a mess: spilled sushi, broken cameras, and a dented remote (dumbbell). The AI scoreboard flickers on the screen again.*

**Siri‑B (robotic, glitchy voice)**  
Processing… *end of show.*  

**STAN (to the crowd)**  
Okay, we’ve had a *lot* of noise. Any final thoughts?

**KYLE (to the camera)**  
Maybe we should stop judging each other and start… *really* listening.

**CHEF (to the crowd)**  
And maybe stop eating pufferfish sushi with your teeth.

**KARTMAN (pointing at the AI)**  
I’m not saying the algorithm is *foolish,* but if we’re being judged, I have a *second* opinion.

**Randy (to the crowd)**  
I thought this was a show about watching the *people* who are watching us.

**GARRISON (to the camera)**  
And I thought it was about *judging* people who… *watch* us.

*The camera crew (the town’s kids in selfie‑stick mode) start filming a “post‑show” segment.*

**Randy’s Inner Critic (voiceover)**  
We’re *finally* on the right track!  

**Randy (to everyone)**  
All right, let’s wrap up. *Stan,* you’re the winner of $100,000.

**STAN (flustered)**  
Uh… thanks. I’ll—  

**CHEF (interrupting)**  
Hold up, Stan! You’re supposed to *share* the money with the town.  

**GARRISON (to Stan)**  
And you, Kyle, did *great* on the debate.  

**KYLE (to Randy)**  
You should… maybe take a break from being the *big brother*.

---

**INT. HOUSE OF CAMERAS – RANDO'S COMMAND CENTER (post‑show)**

*The command center is a wreck. Randy sits alone, surrounded by broken gadgets and the remote (dumbbell) that keeps squeaking.*

**Randy (softly)**  
I thought controlling everything was… *important.*

*A faint, soothing voice comes from the hologram of his inner critic; it’s less mocking now.*

**Randy’s Inner Critic (soft)**  
You’re not a *science‑scapegoat.* You’re… *someone who’s seen the world.*

**Randy (nods slowly)**  
And I guess… *everyone* is watching.

*A gentle knock on the door; Sharon enters, holding a steaming cup of coffee.*

**SHARON (cheerful)**  
Hey! I heard the music. Want a coffee?  

**Randy (smiles, reaches out)**  
Sure, Sharon. That would be… *great.*

*Sharon sits next to him; the hologram fades into a tiny, smiling duck animation.*

**SHARON (to Randy)**  
You’re like… *the biggest star* in this town.

**Randy (laughs)**  
I’ve never been a *star,* Sharon. I’m just… here.

**SHARON (squeezes his shoulder)**  
It’s okay, Randy. You’re the biggest thing we’ve got.

*A beat passes; they both laugh softly.*

**GARRISON (off‑stage, to the camera)**  
And that’s all for today. The big brother has… *been replaced* by the real big brother.

---

**EXT. SOUTH PARK STREETS – NIGHT**

*A billboard on Main Street reads: “Big Brother? No. Big Friends.” The lights flicker like a rubber duck squeak. A voice‑over (the same AI) says in an oddly soothing tone:**

**Siri‑B (cheery)**  
Thank you for watching South Park! Stay tuned, stay silly, and maybe… *don’t let the algorithm judge you.*

*The camera pulls back to reveal the town’s kids walking down Main Street, each holding a different snack—Chef’s pufferfish sushi in a basket, Randy with a coffee, and the rest of the gang laughing.*

**STAN (to the camera)**  
So… *what’s next?*  

**KYLE (smiling, to Stan)**  
We’ll see. But maybe next time we’ll stay *under* the radar.

**CHEF (to everyone)**  
And maybe keep the sushi in a *safe* place!

**GARRISON (to Randy)**  
You, my boy—don’t forget to *watch* the little ones.  

**Randy (to everyone)**  
I’ll keep an eye on you all… *as a friend.*

*The screen fades to black, the rubber‑duck squeak echoing one last time.*  

**END.**
