**Episode Outline – “Big Brother: South Park Edition”**  
*(Matt Stone – Grounded voice, keeping the chaos believable)*

### 1. PREMISE  
The next season of *Big Brother* is shot on a remote ranch, but this year the producers decide to “take it to the next level” and throw a twist: the entire cast is made up of *South Park* residents. The house sits in the middle of town, and the contestants are forced to play for a $100,000 prize while being watched by the entire town (and, of course, the “Big Brother” camera crew). The premise is a satire of reality‑TV voyeurism: we see the same characters, but under “high stakes” conditions that expose their true selves.

### 2. CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS  
| Character | Core Motivation (Realistic) | Why it’s believable |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Stan Marsh** | Wants to prove he’s more than a “goofy sidekick.” He sees the show as a chance to step out of Kyle’s shadow. | Stan is always looking for personal validation; this fits his arc from “just a kid” to “someone with agency.” |
| **Kyle Broflovski** | Seeks moral clarity. He wants to expose the game’s manipulation and keep the show honest. | Kyle is the “voice of reason”; he would naturally try to maintain integrity even in a twisted setting. |
| **Eric Cartman** | Seeks power and money; will use any means to win. | Cartman’s ambition is a constant; the prize gives him a tangible goal. |
| **Kenny McCormick** | Wants to survive the game, but also to protect his friends. He’s protective of Stan and Kyle. | Kenny often acts as the emotional anchor; protecting others is consistent with his character. |
| **Butters Stotch** | Seeks acceptance; will do anything to fit in, even if it means compromising his values. | Butters’ naivety and desire for approval make him a classic “sacrificing” character. |
| **Token** | Wants to prove he’s more than a stereotype; will use the platform to speak out. | Token’s history of fighting for representation fits this motivation. |
| **Mr. Garrison** | Seeks fame; will manipulate the show for personal gain. | Garrison’s desire to be in the spotlight is a recurring theme. |
| **Chef** | Wants to keep everyone safe; will act as the “guardian angel” of the house. | Chef’s protective nature is well‑established; he will try to shield the kids from harm. |

### 3. LOGICAL PROGRESSION  
1. **Opening Montage** – The town gathers as the *Big Brother* crew sets up the house, a giant “South Park” sign appears.  
   *Cut to:* Contestants entering the house, each greeted by a camera crew that speaks in a deadpan reality‑TV tone.

   - **Stan** builds something sturdy but bland.  
   - **Cartman** tries to sabotage others, but the house’s “smart” door locks him out of his own shelter.  
   - **Kenny** quietly helps others, earning a “team spirit” bonus.  
4. **First Eviction** – The town votes; butters is evicted due to a viral clip of him accidentally turning the house into a dance floor.  
   *Consequence:* Butters feels abandoned, but the town’s reaction is “We’ll miss you!”—the show’s satire of how quickly fans move on.

   - **Cartman** tries to use it to control votes, but the AI flips back on him.

   *Consequence:* Token feels betrayed but also realizes the show’s platform can be used for activism.  
7. **Climactic Challenge** – “The Great Debate”: contestants must debate a current social issue while the camera crew livestreams.  
   - **Stan** defends his personal growth.  
   - **Cartman** tries to dominate the debate but gets interrupted by a “censor” (the AI).  
   - **Chef** steps in, offering a heartfelt speech about community.  
8. **Final Eviction & Winner** – The town votes; Stan wins narrowly, but Cartman’s manipulations are exposed by the AI.

### 4. EMOTIONAL BEATS  
- **Butters’ Eviction** – Cut to a close‑up of Butters in the house, crying. The camera crew plays his “funny” clip on a loop. He’s left alone, showing the emotional toll of being cast out for a laugh.  
- **Token’s Speech** – Token delivers a short, heartfelt speech about identity and representation; the town’s cheers are mixed with snide comments. The moment is powerful because it shows a character fighting for something bigger than the prize.  
- **Chef’s Intervention** – During the final debate, Chef breaks down on a rug, pleading for unity. He’s shown wiping tears, highlighting his role as the moral center of the town and the house.  
- **Stan’s Reflection** – After winning, Stan sits alone in his room, looking at the prize money. He talks to himself about how it feels to have “earned” something but at what cost: the friendships, the nights of lying.  

These beats ground the episode in genuine feelings even amid absurdity.

### 5. PRACTICAL RESOLUTION  
- **Return to Normalcy** – The episode ends with the contestants leaving the house, each stepping back into their everyday lives.  
- **Stan’s Decision** – He chooses to donate part of his winnings to a local charity, showing that the money now has real-world impact.  
- **Kyle’s Lesson** – He writes an article for the school paper about how media can manipulate truth, hinting that he will continue to fight against misinformation.  
- **Cartman’s Consequence** – He is briefly black‑listed by the local radio station for his manipulative tactics, illustrating that “cheating” has professional repercussions.  
- **Closing Scene** – The camera crew leaves the town, and a voice‑over says, “And that’s how we keep America entertained.” The crew looks at the camera and shrugs, leaving the audience to reflect on the line between entertainment and exploitation.  

**Moral/Point (subtle, not preachy):** *Reality TV’s allure is real, but the human cost—relationships, integrity, and community—remains a price no amount of money can easily pay off.*
