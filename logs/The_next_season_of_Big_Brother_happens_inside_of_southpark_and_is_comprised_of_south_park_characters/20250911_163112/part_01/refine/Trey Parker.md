## 1. Three‑Act Structure

| Act | Time (min) | Core Beats | Hook / Cliffhanger |
|-----|------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Act I – The Big‑Brother Invasion** | 0–7 | • Mayor Stan announces a *real‑time* reality show to “boost tourism.” <br>• Randy is chosen as the unseen host (the *Big Brother* of South Park). <br>• The kids are forced into a house full of cameras; the “home” is actually a giant, wobbly set. <br>• Randy builds his basement command center; the remote is a dumbbell that keeps ricocheting into sprinklers. | Randy’s remote‑as‑dumbbell causes a sprinkler flood that drenches the entire town—“The Great Flood of 2025.” |
| **Act II – Control & Chaos** | 7–18 | • The AI “Scoreboard” (Siri‑B) starts giving “sincerity scores.” <br>• First eviction: Butters is voted out after a viral clip of him dancing. <br>• Randy’s rule‑making spirals: “All greetings must be theatrical; no emojis.” <br>• Token is evicted after a heated debate on representation; Siri‑B gives him an “inspirational” score. <br>• Kyle hacks Siri‑B to expose the glitch (“Sincerity Score” is just a random number). <br>• Cartman hacks the AI to manipulate votes; Randy’s remote accidentally hits Siri‑B, causing a glitch that reveals Cartman’s plan. | The AI glitches to a “NO SCORE” screen—everyone is suddenly *unrated* and the town goes wild. |
| **Act III – The Great Debate & Duck‑Camera Reveal** | 18–30 | • “The Great Debate” segment: kids debate a current issue while the AI livestreams. <br>• Randy pulls out the house’s “exit door,” accidentally opening a tunnel into a cornfield, sending everyone tumbling out. <br>• Mid‑scene break: the cameras are revealed to be a giant rubber duck that squeaks whenever someone records. <br>• Final eviction: Stan wins the $100,000 prize but is visibly exhausted; Cartman’s manipulation is exposed. <br>• Randy has an epiphany in the command center: “I’m scared we’ll forget me.” | The town cheers for Randy’s “Big Brother” moment, but the rubber‑duck squeaks—“The Big Brother is a duck!” The episode ends with Randy hugging Sharon, who gives him a genuine “hand.” |

## 2. Satirical Focus

| Target | How It’s Mocked |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Surveillance Culture** | Every corner of the town is a camera; the kids literally become “selfie‑stick‑holding” props. |
| **Algorithmic Judgment** | Siri‑B’s “sincerity score” is a random number generator; the town votes based on an absurd spreadsheet that looks like a glitchy calculator. |
| **Reality‑TV Commodification** | The show sells “Kyle’s Moral Lessons” as a pay‑per‑view special; Randy sells “Randy’s Air‑Freshener 3‑Pack” during the broadcast. |
| **Political Polarization** | The debate segment devolves into caricature punditry; each side only attacks the other. |
| **Social‑Media Fandoms** | Hashtags, bots, and a “Trending” feed that never changes. |
| **Control & Ego** | Randy’s compulsive rule‑making mirrors the absurdity of “big‑brother” paranoia. |

## 3. Character Beats (Motivation → Key Moment)

| Character | Motivation | Key Moment |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Randy** | Fear of being replaced → over‑control. | Remote‑as‑dumbbell mishap, final epiphany “I’m scared we’ll forget me.” |
| **Cartman** | Power & money. | Hacks AI, gets caught, black‑listed by the local radio station. |
| **Kyle** | Moral integrity. | Exposes AI glitch, writes a school‑paper article about media manipulation. |
| **Stan** | Validation & adventure. | Wins prize, exhausted, donates money to charity. |
| **Chef** | Food‑porn influencer. | Gives heartfelt “food for the soul” speech during debate. |
| **Butters** | Acceptance. | Evicted after viral clip, later “celebrated” by the town. |
| **Token** | Representation. | Evicted, but his speech is remembered; later referenced in the debate. |
| **Mayor Stan** | Boost tourism & popularity. | Announces the show, becomes a reluctant host. |
| **Sharon** | Supportive spouse. | Gives Randy a genuine hug at the end. |

## 5. Creative Choices & Reasoning

| Choice | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Remote‑as‑dumbbell** | Physical gag that ties Randy’s ego to a literal “tool of control.” |
| **AI Scoreboard (Siri‑B)** | Satirizes data‑mining & algorithmic bias; gives kids an “objective” metric that is actually arbitrary. |
| **Rubber‑duck Reveal** | Classic South Park twist: the “big brother” is a silly prop, turning surveillance satire into absurdity. |
| **Adult Caricatures** | Randy as “producer,” Garrison as narcissistic judge, Chef as food‑porn influencer – lampoons media tropes. |
| **Musical Climax** | Keeps the episode energetic; lets us deliver the moral in a sing‑along that’s both catchy and critical. |
| **Emotional Payoff** | Randy’s vulnerable moment, Sharon’s hug, the town’s toast – these give the episode a heart‑warming finish without diluting the satire. |

## 6. Final Takeaway

“Big Brother? Big Frustration!” blends Randy’s neurotic need for control with a glitchy AI scoreboard, and ends on a classic South Park absurdity: the whole “Big Brother” machine is just a rubber‑duck camera. The episode satirizes surveillance culture, algorithmic judgment, and reality‑TV commodification while still delivering the emotional beat that Randy learns he’s already “big enough.” The town realizes it’s the *friends* who keep them sane. The moral is wrapped in humor, a musical number, and a genuine hug—exactly the South Park recipe.
