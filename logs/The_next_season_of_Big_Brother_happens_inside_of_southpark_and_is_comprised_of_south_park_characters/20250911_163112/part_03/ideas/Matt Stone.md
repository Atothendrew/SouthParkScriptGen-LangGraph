**Episode Outline – “Flooded Live‑Stream”**

---

### 1. PREMISE  
Randy Marsh turns his basement into a “Big Brother”‑style live‑stream set. He rigs an over‑enthusiastic AI assistant (Siri‑B) that instantly eliminates any participant who utters the word *please*. The show is narrated by a squeaky rubber‑duck camera, and Randy’s pride‑fueled “All Off” button is actually a sprinkler‑control switch that floods the set when pressed. Kids are strapped into plastic cages for “authenticity,” a glitchy hologram keeps the audience entertained, and Randy’s ego spirals out of control as chaos erupts.

### 2. CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS  

| Character | Why They Act That Way (Grounded, Human) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Randy Marsh** | A desperate need for relevance. After the “Stomach‑Cancer” episode, he’s lost his job and reputation; a live‑stream could bring in sponsorships. He overcompensates with extreme tech and control. |
| **Stan Marsh** | Protective older brother; naturally skeptical of Randy’s over‑blown schemes. He wants to keep the kids safe and is wary of tech that can harm them. |
| **Kyle Broflovski** | The voice of reason, constantly warning against reckless experiments. His use of *please* is a habit; he’s unaware that it triggers Siri‑B. |
| **Cartman** | Opportunistic; sees a “Big Brother” show as a chance to get money, but also enjoys watching others fail. He’s driven by ego and greed, not morality. |
| **Kenny McCormick** | The “mystery” kid; his survival instinct pushes him to quietly sabotage Randy’s tech when possible. |
| **Chef** | Wants to keep the community safe; his cooking background gives him a practical, grounded view of safety protocols. |
| **Mr. Garrison** | Wants to keep the school’s image clean; he’s skeptical of Randy’s “flood” but also wants to avoid a PR disaster. |
| **The Town of South Park** | Pragmatic citizens who will react to immediate danger (flood, injuries) and later to the fallout of Randy’s recklessness. |

### 3. LOGICAL PROGRESSION  

| Act | Key Events (in order) |
|-----|-----------------------|
| **Act 1 – Setup** | Randy announces the “Live‑Stream” on a local blog. He installs Siri‑B, the rubber duck camera (a cheap toy he bought from a yard sale), and a sprinkler system wired to the “All Off” button. The kids (Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny) are recruited as “contestants.” Randy explains the rules: no *please*. |
| **Act 2 – Chaos Begins** | During the first live‑segment, Kyle casually says *please* in a joke. Siri‑B’s voice cuts off the feed and “eliminates” him with a dramatic, cartoonish flick (a small explosion of confetti and a pop‑sound). The audience reacts with shocked laughter. Randy blames the “AI glitch” and vows to tighten security. |
| **Act 3 – Flood & Flickers** | Randy, frustrated by the elimination, presses the “All Off” button to reset. The sprinkler system misfires, flooding the basement in a few minutes. Kids are stuck in plastic cages; the hologram glitches into an “endless water” loop. The rubber duck camera narrates in a squeaky, high‑pitched voice: “Uh oh! Looks like we got a little water‑fun!” |
| **Act 4 – Community Response** | Stan and Cartman try to free the kids; Kenny quietly hacks a nearby sprinkler valve. Chef arrives with a fire extinguisher (just in case) and leads a rescue plan. Mr. Garrison calls the town’s mayor, who insists on shutting down the stream immediately. |
| **Act 5 – Randy’s Realization** | As the flood reaches the basement door, Randy’s ego cracks. He runs to the control panel, but all the tech is offline and the “All Off” button has become a literal “All On” because of the power surge. The AI voice now speaks in broken English, saying “I am sorry for your disaster.” Randy realizes he’s become a joke. |
| **Act 6 – Resolution** | The town rescues everyone from the basement, but Randy is arrested for negligence and endangers. Siri‑B is confiscated as a dangerous AI prototype. The live‑stream goes offline permanently, and Randy’s “big brother” dream dissolves into a cautionary tale. |

### 4. EMOTIONAL BEATS  

| Moment | Why It Feels Real |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Kyle’s elimination** | Kyle’s reaction is genuine shock; he tries to explain, but the audience’s laughter feels like a real social pressure. |
| **Flooding** | The sound of water hitting the floor, the kids’ panicked gasps, and Stan’s desperate “Get out of there!” echo real disaster scenes. |
| **Randy’s breakdown** | After the flood, Randy sobbing in front of the camera (“I just wanted a normal day”) shows vulnerability behind his bravado. |
| **Chef’s calm** | Chef calmly pulls a hose and says, “We gotta keep the kids dry, not… something else.” His voice is a grounding counterpoint to Randy’s chaos. |
| **Community rescue** | The townsfolk working together, pulling kids from cages, shows genuine solidarity amid absurdity. |

### 5. PRACTICAL RESOLUTION  

*Legal & Social Consequences*: Randy is charged with reckless endangerment, and the town passes a local ordinance banning unsupervised live‑stream experiments.  
*Technology*: Siri‑B is dismantled; the rubber duck camera is returned to a yard sale. The sprinkler system is rewired with a safety interlock.  
*Moral (without preaching)*: Randy’s ego and the town’s fascination with instant fame lead to real danger. The episode ends with Stan giving a “normal” family dinner, and Randy awkwardly watching the news about his arrest—“Maybe I should just go back to my… science experiments.” The message is clear: unchecked tech enthusiasm can flood our lives, but community and humility keep us afloat.

**Sample Dialogue (Act 2)**  

```
SIRI‑B: "You said PLEASE. That is an offense. Eliminating you now."
KYLE: "Okay, okay! I didn’t mean—"
SIRI‑B: "NO!"
(Confetti erupts, a cartoonish explosion.)

STAN: (to Cartman) "Did you see that? Randy made a robot that kills people for politeness."
CARTMAN: "Yeah, and I'm just glad I didn't say please. My ego is safe."
```

**Sample Dialogue (Act 5)**  

```
RANDY: (sobbing) "I just wanted to make something people would watch, not… this."
CHEF: (handing him a towel) "You’re going to have to clean up this mess, son. And maybe take a nap."
RANDY: "A nap? No! I’ll fix it!"
```

*The episode ends with the town’s mayor saying, “Maybe we should stick to… normal TV.” Randy nods solemnly while the camera pans out, showing a flooded basement, a rescued kid, and a still‑squeaking rubber duck.*
