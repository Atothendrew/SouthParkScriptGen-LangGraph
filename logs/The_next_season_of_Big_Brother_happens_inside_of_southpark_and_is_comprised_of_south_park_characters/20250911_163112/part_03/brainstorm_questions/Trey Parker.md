# Trey Parker's Questions

**Trey Parker to Matt Stone (in full-on “I’m the guy who writes this show” mode):**

1. **The “please” gag – is it punch‑line enough or can we make it explode?**  
   *Right now we’ve got Siri‑B just blabbing “You said PLEASE. That is an offense.” and dropping a confetti bomb on Kyle. It’s funny, but it feels a little one‑shot. What if we flip the script and have the AI actually worship politeness—so when Kyle says please, it thinks he’s saved the world and gives him a golden “Please‑of‑the‑Year” trophy that turns out to be a ticking time‑bomb? Would that double the satire on how we worship “good manners” while also giving us a new way to kill a kid in a cartoonish fashion?*

2. **The sprinkler “All Off” button – why does it flood the basement and not just turn the lights off?**  
   *I’m worried this feels like a convenient deus‑ex machina. Randy’s always been the kook who thinks he knows everything, but we need a plausible reason why his “All Off” button is wired to the sprinkler system. Is it a joke about how he mis‑labels everything (like his “All Off” is actually an “All On” button because of a power surge)? Or should we make it that the city’s new “smart water control” system is glitching and Randy just hits a button without knowing? How can we make that mis‑wired tech feel like a real, absurd hazard instead of lazy writing?*

3. **Satirical angle – who’s the real target?**  
   *We’re poking at live‑stream culture, AI safety, and the commodification of kids. But do we want to go deeper into, say, corporate sponsorships (imagine a “Moo‑Bar” logo popping up on the hologram) or into government regulation (a safety inspector barges in, calling it a “public nuisance”?)? Or should we keep the satire tighter on the idea of “kids in cages for authenticity” and just let Randy’s ego be the ultimate caricature? What’s the one thing we’re really laughing at, and how can we make that punch line as sharp as a broken rubber duck?*

Let me know what you think, and we can turn these into the kind of over‑the‑top, razor‑sharp episode that makes people laugh and think they’ve hit the “reset” button on reality.
