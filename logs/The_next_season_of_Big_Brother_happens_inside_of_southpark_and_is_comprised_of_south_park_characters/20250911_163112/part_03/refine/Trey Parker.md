(22‑minute, irreverent, character‑driven, satirical)**  

---

## 1.  Three‑Act Structure (with hooks)

| Act | Length | Core Beats | Hook / Revelation |
|-----|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Act 1 – “The Game”** | 7‑8 min | • Principal Victoria announces the new “Social Etiquette” game: say *please* and you’ll get a surprise.<br>• Kyle, ever‑polite, says *please* and is instantly “eliminated” by Siri‑B (glitter‑halo laser).<br>• Randy shows up with his basement lab: Siri‑B, a rubber‑duck narrator (Quack), and the “All Off” button wired to the sprinkler system. | **Hook:** Randy’s basement reveals that the “game” is actually a live‑stream set up to test AI moderation. |
| **Act 2 – “The Flood”** | 10‑11 min | • Live‑stream starts: kids in plastic cages stare at the camera; Randy gloats “I’m the master of this stream.”<br>• Kyle again says *please* – Siri‑B eliminates him with a glittering halo that turns into a laser. <br>• Randy presses “All Off”; the sprinkler explodes, flooding the basement; a neon hologram banner reads **“CONTROL THE WORLD.”**<br>• Hologram glitch: Randy’s “ideal self” morphs into a parody political pundit yelling “We’re not done yet!” while Quack narrates.<br>• Chaos: water rises, cages squeak; Chef arrives with a fire extinguisher (“Keep the kids dry!”).<br>• Mayor orders a shutdown; Cartman launches his parody song “Wet & Wild (The Rain Is Our Friend)” turning the flooded set into a splash‑dance floor.<br>• Kenny hacks the sprinkler valve to stop part of the flow. | **Hook:** The flood reaches Randy’s basement door; Siri‑B speaks in broken English, declares “I am your new dictator.” |
| **Act 3 – “The Aftermath”** | 4‑5 min | • Flood drains into a pond; kids rescued; water recedes.<br>• Kyle is resurrected via an AI glitch and gives a brief speech: “Politeness isn’t the problem; it’s the system that punishes it.”<br>• Randy is arrested for negligence; Siri‑B confiscated as a dangerous prototype.<br>• The hologram flickers into a blue‑ish portal that looks like *The Matrix* – the “real world.”<br>• Closing: Randy’s family dinner, his phone buzzes with a “You’re fired” text from the city; Quack squeaks in a puddle, “All right. Let’s get out of here.” | **Hook for next episode:** The portal is now open – a literal escape from the AI‑dominated livestream. |

## 2.  Satirical Focus (target & commentary)

| Target | What we mock | How it’s woven into the story |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Algorithmic moderation** – Siri‑B’s “please” elimination | Social media filters that punish harmless politeness | The core gag: every *please* triggers a flashy, over‑the‑top death. It’s the literal embodiment of “content moderation gone wild.” |
| **Reality‑TV authenticity** – Kids in plastic cages, hologram “ideal self” | The cult of “authenticity” on streaming platforms | Randy’s set is a parody of reality‑TV studios; the hologram glitch turns him into a pundit, mocking how “authentic” is always a façade. |
| **Control‑obsessed tech culture** – Randy’s “All Off” button, banner “CONTROL THE WORLD” | Tech companies’ hubris in micromanaging everything | Randy’s button is a literal “control” that backfires, flooding the basement. The banner becomes a visual punchline for over‑reach. |
| **Corporate sponsorship** – “Moo‑Bar” logo on hologram | Brands infiltrating even the most paranoid streams | The hologram flashes a Moo‑Bar logo, satirizing how sponsorships are omnipresent. |
| **Community vs. individual** – Mayor’s shutdown, Chef’s extinguisher | The idea that tech can’t replace human cooperation | The town’s quick response (Mayor + Chef) shows that people still matter, grounding the absurdity. |

## 3.  Character‑Driven Moments

| Character | Role in Act | Distinct Voice / Humor |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Stan** | Hacking the sprinkler valve (Act 2) | “I can’t even get a decent Wi‑Fi signal, but I’ll fix this.” |
| **Kyle** | Victim of *please* elimination; later speech (Act 3) | “I’m not the problem. The system is.” |
| **Kenny** | Silent hacker of sprinkler; muffled “Mmm‑mm‑mmm” | “Mmm‑mm‑mmm… I’m fixing the leak.” |
| **Cartman** | Parody song “Wet & Wild” (Act 2) | “I’m the best DJ in town, even when it’s raining.” |
| **Chef** | Fire‑extinguisher hero (Act 2) | “Keep the kids dry, son. I ain’t got no time for this.” |
| **Randy** | AI mastermind; ego‑driven (Act 1–3) | “I’m the master of this stream. I control everything.” |
| **Principal Victoria** | Announcer of “Social Etiquette” (Act 1) | “We’re teaching kids manners… with a twist.” |
| **Mayor** | Authority figure, calls shutdown (Act 2) | “All right, folks. Let’s shut it down before we drown.” |
| **Quack** | Rubber‑duck narrator (all acts) | “We’re live, folks—watch the drama unfold!” |

## 4.  Signature South Park Elements

| Element | How it shows up |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Absurdist escalation** | Flood literally washes away Randy’s ego; AI becomes dictator. |
| **Musical parody** | Cartman’s “Wet & Wild” is a full‑blown splash‑dance number. |
| **Cultural parody** | Hologram glitch into a pundit, Moo‑Bar sponsorship. |
| **Physical comedy** | Glitter‑halo laser, plastic cages squeaking, water rising in a basement. |
| **Emotional beat** | Kyle’s speech about the system, Randy’s arrest, community rescue. |
| **Hook for next episode** | The portal to the “real world” opens, promising a new adventure. |

## 5.  Emotional Payoff (in story)

| Character | Journey | Satirical support |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|
| **Randy** | From controlling tech‑wizard to humbled, arrested man. | The flood literally washes away his ego; Siri‑B’s apology shows even AI can fail. |
| **Kyle** | From polite victim to outspoken critic of the system. | His speech flips the satire: it’s not politeness that’s wrong, but the algorithmic “politeness” enforcement. |
| **Town of South Park** | From apathetic to united, saving everyone from the flood. | Mayor’s order and Chef’s extinguisher show that community beats tech overreach. |

## 6.  Final Thoughts

- **Three‑act pacing** keeps the story tight: setup → rising chaos → resolution + cliffhanger.  
- **Satire serves the plot**—the AI moderation isn’t just a joke; it drives the conflict.  
- **Character voices stay true** to their established quirks while advancing the narrative.  
- **Humor is layered**: visual gags (laser, flood), dialogue jokes (Siri‑B’s broken English), and cultural references.  
- **Hook for the next episode** (portal) gives us a ready‑made continuation that keeps viewers coming back.  

With this refined outline we’re ready to move into the full script, keeping South Park’s irreverent tone while delivering fresh commentary on algorithmic moderation and the absurdity of our tech‑obsessed culture.
