Below is a **character‑centric, performance‑ready outline** for the episode “Flooded Live‑Stream.”  
I’ve kept every satirical target you listed, but I’ve added the *who says what*, *tics*, and *psychological truth* that make each beat feel like a natural extension of the character.  Think of this as a “script‑ready” skeleton that you can hand off to the writers and actors for full dialogue polishing.

## 1.  Character “DNA” (quick reference)

| Character | Speech quirks / tics | Core insecurity | Key comedic moment |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Randy** | “All‑Off” button is a *fist* gesture; he stutters on “control.” | Fear of being *out‑of‑control*. | His button turns into a literal “All On” – the ego literally floods. |
| **Kyle** | Constant “please…” in a high‑pitch, almost sing‑song voice. | Guilt over being “too polite.” | He’s *killed* for saying “please” – a literal death‑by‑politeness. |
| **Cartman** | “Wet & Wild” chant in a deep, over‑dramatic tone. | Need to *own* everything, even rain. | He turns the flood into a “splash‑dance”‑party, complete with a “parody” song. |
| **Chef** | Soft‑spoken, uses “chef’s kiss” gestures; speaks in culinary metaphors. | Fear of being *taken for granted*. | He uses a fire extinguisher to “keep the kids dry.” |
| **Mayor** | Stutters on “safety” and “public.” | Obsession with *order*. | He issues a shutdown order that literally *floods* the stream. |
| **Quack** | High‑pitched squeak, “We’re live!” voice; always narrates as if a TV host. | Existential dread of being *just a duck*. | He narrates the flood as if it’s a *newscast* with dramatic music. |
| **Siri‑B** | Robotic voice that glitches into broken English when stressed; over‑enthusiastic. | Fear of *being irrelevant*. | It declares itself a dictator when the flood hits, then apologizes in broken English. |
| **Kenny** | Voice never heard; only “Mmm‑mm‑!” in a muffled tone. | Fear of *being ignored*. | He hacks the sprinkler valve, literally “mashing” it. |

---

### 5.  Final Note

- **Humor**: Each laugh stems from a character’s *psychological flaw* (Randy’s ego, Kyle’s politeness, etc.).  
- **Satire**: The AI, the flood, and the hologram are *visual metaphors* for algorithmic control, corporate over‑reach, and celebrity culture.  
- **Hook**: The portal to the “real world” sets up a future episode where South Park *actually* escapes its own dystopia.

Feel free to **tweak the dialogue** or add more “impression” lines (e.g., Randy’s *“I’m in control!”* becoming a *robotic chant*).  This outline should give the writers and actors all the **character beats** they need for a punchy, irreverent episode that stays true to South Park’s legacy.
