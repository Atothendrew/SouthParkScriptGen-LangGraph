# Part 3 Prompt\n\nContinuing from the previous part: Randy Marsh hijacks his basement to launch a “Big Brother”‑style live stream, complete with an over‑enthusiastic AI called Siri‑B that instantly eliminates Kyle for saying the word “please.”  The show is punctuated by a squeaky rubber‑duck‑camera that narrates every move and a wild sprinkler system that floods the set when Randy presses a mis‑named “All Off” button.  As chaos escalates—kids strapped in plastic cages, a glitchy hologram, and a flood‑filled basement—Randy scrambles to regain control while the town’s reality‑TV experiment spirals into absurdity.  The episode satirizes tech‑obsessed entertainment, the cult of politeness, and Randy’s relentless ego with classic South Park irreverence and slap‑stick satire.\n\nUnresolved plotlines to address: Unresolved plotline detected\n\n## Continuity Context\n\n**Part 3 of 10**\n\n**Original Prompt:** The next season of Big Brother happens inside of southpark and is comprised of south park characters\n\n**Previous Parts:**\n- Part 1: In this over‑the‑top South Park episode, Randy Marsh launches a town‑wide “Big Brother” reality show that turns every house into a live‑streamed experiment. With his basement control center (complete with a squeaky dumbbell “remote” and an obnoxious AI scoreboard called Siri‑B), Randy keeps the kids strapped to cameras while the town watches—and gets a few surprises, like an accidental sprinkler apocalypse and a rogue rubber‑duck‑headed camera. As the AI starts eliminating contestants (Kyle gets kicked out for being too polite), chaos erupts, Chef’s pufferfish sushi turns into a cyber‑food nightmare, and Randy finally realizes that the real power lies not in controlling everyone but in letting the absurdity of being watched unfold. The episode ends with Randy stepping back from his “big brother” ego, the town embracing their own chaotic freedom, and a final gag of a squeaky duck echoing through the streets. The tone remains irreverent, satirical, and character‑driven, true to South Park’s brand of absurd social commentary.\n- Part 2: Randy Marsh hijacks his basement to launch a “Big Brother”‑style live stream, complete with an over‑enthusiastic AI called Siri‑B that instantly eliminates Kyle for saying the word “please.”  The show is punctuated by a squeaky rubber‑duck‑camera that narrates every move and a wild sprinkler system that floods the set when Randy presses a mis‑named “All Off” button.
