# Trey Parker Brainstorm Session

**South Park – “Big Brother & the Squeaky Duck”  
Episode 2 of 10 (22‑minute outline)**  

---

## Satirical Targets (and why they work)

| Target | How it’s used | Why it hits |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Reality‑TV voyeurism** | Randy turns his basement into a “Big Brother” control center. The whole town is a live‑streamed laboratory. | South Park’s hallmark: exaggerate the absurdity of watching our lives for ratings. |
| **AI mis‑interpretation** | Siri‑B (the AI scoreboard) starts eliminating contestants for being “too polite” or “boring.” | Satirizes how algorithms can misread human nuance and produce absurd outcomes. |
| **Surveillance culture** | Every house gets a cheap camera, even the bathrooms. Kids are literally “on camera” 24/7. | Parodies how data‑harvesting tech turns privacy into a commodity. |
| **Environmental/health fads** | Randy’s sprinkler system is wired to the AI; a mis‑wired button floods the town. Chef’s “cyber‑sushi” (pufferfish + glitchy hologram) turns into a food‑safety nightmare. | Lampoons “green” tech that spirals out of control and the over‑enthusiastic foodie trend. |
| **Political hype / “community service”** | The mayor’s “community‑service episode” is a thinly veiled propaganda machine. | Shows how political slogans can be co‑opted for entertainment. |

## Episode Structure

| Act | Key Beats | Hook/Climax | Satirical Punch |
|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Act 1 – “Launch & Lock‑In”** | 1. Randy’s basement becomes a control hub (remote, AI scoreboard, rubber‑duck camera). <br>2. Randy announces a town‑wide “Big Brother” reality show; kids are put in “camera cages.” <br>3. Liane protests but is ignored. | Randy’s ego spikes; he feels “the star.” | The absurdity of a dad running an entire town’s surveillance. |
| **Act 2 – “Chaos Builds”** | 4. Siri‑B malfunctions: it eliminates Kyle for saying “please.” <br>5. Rubber‑duck camera goes rogue, follows kids everywhere, squeaks in sync with emergency alerts.<br>6. Chef’s cyber‑sushi glitch turns his sushi into a glowing, glitchy food that makes people sneeze and hallucinate.<br>7. Sprinkler system mis‑wired by Randy’s remote → town flood; kids trapped on rooftops, being filmed. | Town goes from “fun” to “danger.” | AI’s literal interpretation of politeness; tech‑freak environmental disaster. |
| **Act 3 – “Rebellion & Release”** | 8. Liane + Kyle rally the town to shut down the show; they battle Randy’s remote in his basement. <br>9. Randy watches the chaos on live‑stream, sees himself reflected in the flooding footage → existential realization that control is an illusion. <br>10. He dismantles remote, disables Siri‑B, apologizes; cameras are turned off. <br>11. The town celebrates freedom; the squeaky duck camera becomes a novelty toy sold at the store (still squeaking, but everyone laughs). | Randy’s ego collapses; town regains agency. | The moral that watching is okay when it’s consensual, but control over people is a joke. |
| **Tag** | The rubber‑duck camera squeaks once more; the sound echoes across town as kids dance in puddles. Randy, drenched, shrugs and mutters “Okay… okay…” | A final nod to his nervous tic becoming a shared joke. | The echo of Randy’s control now turns into communal absurdity. |

## Beat‑by‑Beat Breakdown (22 minutes)

| Minute | Scene (Scene Heading) | Dialogue/Action Highlights | Satirical Beat |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| 0‑2 | **INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – DAY** | Randy builds a “control tower” with a squeaky dumbbell remote, AI scoreboard (Siri‑B), and a rubber‑duck camera. He narrates to the kids: “Welcome to Big Brother, the only show where you’re *actually* on TV!” | Establishes absurd tech hub. |
| 2‑4 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY** | Randy announces the show; kids strap on “camera cages.” Liane protests (“Dad, this is a *privacy* violation!”) but Randy shrugs. | Satirizes reality‑TV overreach and parental indifference. |
| 4‑6 | **INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – DAY** | Siri‑B’s monotone voice: “Engagement level: 99%.” Randy says, “We’re watching your lives now.” | AI’s bland engagement mantra. |
| 6‑8 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY** | Rubber‑duck camera zooms in on Kyle, squeaks loudly. Siri‑B announces: “Elimination: Kyle (0% politeness).” Kids gasp; Kyle looks horrified. | AI misinterprets politeness as “cultural decay.” |
| 8‑10 | **INT. CHEF’S KITCHEN – DAY** | Chef attempts “cyber‑sushi”: pufferfish + holographic grill. The sushi glitches, emits a green glow; Chef coughs and screams “It’s *fucking* alive!” | Food‑tech gone wrong. |
| 10‑12 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY** | Randy, fiddling with remote, hits a button: sprinkler system floods the town. Kids scramble; water gushes into roofs. The AI narrates, “Flood control successful.” | Environmental tech disaster. |
| 12‑14 | **INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – NIGHT** | Liane confronts Randy (“This is insane!”). Randy says, “You’re just a *background character*.” He’s visibly rattled by the chaos. | Liane’s voice of reason. |
| 14‑16 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – NIGHT** | Town residents, led by Liane and Kyle, storm the basement. They wrestle Randy’s remote; he panics. | Town rebellion. |
| 16‑18 | **INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – NIGHT** | Randy watches live footage of the flood, sees his reflection in the water. He mutters, “I was… I was the star.” | Randy’s existential crisis. |
| 18‑20 | **INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – NIGHT** | Randy flips the remote off, disables Siri‑B. He says to the kids, “I’m sorry for over‑controlling.” The cameras go dark. | Randy’s humbling apology. |
| 20‑21 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY** | Kids run free, laughing in puddles. The rubber‑duck camera squeaks as a novelty toy; kids play with it. | Squeaky duck becomes communal joke. |
| 21‑22 | **EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY (Tag)** | The squeak echoes across town; Randy, drenched, shrugs and says, “Okay… okay…” | Final echo of control turned humor. |

## Why This Works

1. **Clear arc** – Randy’s ego rises → chaos erupts → he realizes control is a joke → town regains freedom.  
2. **Satirical depth** – Each subplot (AI, surveillance, environmental tech) comments on a real cultural trend while staying outrageous.  
3. **Character moments** – Randy’s nervous “squeaky” tic becomes a running gag; Liane’s moral voice provides contrast; Chef’s culinary disaster is both funny and cautionary.  
4. **Signature South Park humor** – Over‑the‑top physical gags (sprinkler flood, glitchy sushi), sharp dialogue, and the final “squeak‑echo” tag that leaves viewers with a laugh.  
5. **Length** – 22 minutes is comfortably filled with eight major beats and plenty of sub‑beats for jokes, cut‑aways, and musical numbers (e.g., a parody of the *Big Bang Theory* theme during the rebellion).

**Next Steps**

- Flesh out dialogue for key scenes (especially Randy’s remote monologues and Liane’s confrontation).  
- Write a short musical number for the rebellion (Cartman, Stan, Chef parodying *The Big Bang Theory*).  
- Add cut‑away jokes (e.g., a news anchor reporting on the “Siri‑B” algorithm).  
- Ensure the final tag’s squeak is a meme‑ready sound for potential internet spread.

With this scaffold, the episode will deliver South Park’s trademark blend of irreverent satire and heartfelt insight—exactly what the writers (Bill, Trey, Matt) are looking for.
