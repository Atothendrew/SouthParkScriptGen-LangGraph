# Episode Script

**South Park – “The Big Brother Basement”**  
*Act One*

---

### INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – DAY  

*A low‑angle shot of a cluttered basement littered with cables, old game consoles, and an ominous, humming box marked “SIRI‑B.” RANDLE (mid‑30s, wild hair, an unshakable grin) strides onto the makeshift stage, clutching a squeaky dumbbell remote. A small crowd of kids—STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN, and ERIC—are strapped into “camera cages” that look suspiciously like a row of plastic kiddie pools.*

**RANDY**  
*(cheerful, manic)*  
Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the first ever South Park “Big Brother” live‑stream! I’m your host, Randy Marsh… *OK… OK…* …and we’re about to watch... **your** life!

*(He hits the remote. A bright squeak ricochets off the walls, and a hologram of SIRI‑B pops up in a pulsing blue light.)*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(cheery, slightly robotic)*  
Welcome, Randy! Engagement level: 100 %. Please tap “Start” to begin.

**RANDY**  
*(throws a grin at the kids)*  
You ready? Remember, we’re all *on camera*—no hiding!

*(Kids glance nervously at the cages.)*

**KYLE**  
(whispering to Stan)   
So… does this mean we’re being recorded all day?

**STAN**  
I hear that! I’m hoping they win a new TV or something.

*(Randy presses the start button again. The remote squeaks louder this time.)*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(over‑dramatic)*  
And here we see the very first citizen of South Park—Stan Marsh—stepping into the spotlight! Watch his every move.

**LIAANE (O.S.)**  
*(from the hallway, calling out)*  
Randy! That remote… looks like a microwave.

**RANDY**  
*(laughing)*  
It’s a high‑tech “microwave‑remote.” It heats, it scans…it basically… *cooks* your attention.

*(The kids giggle. Carter leans forward, squinting at the hologram.)*

**CARTMAN**  
*(snarky)*  
I guess you’re about to steam us all, Randy.

---

### INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – CONTINUOUS  

*SIRI‑B’s hologram flickers as it streams data. The camera cages buzz with static.*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(softly)*  
Now… let us observe the first violation: Kyle Marsh. He has spoken the forbidden word—“please”—a total of 1,234 times today.

**KYLE**  
*(confused)*  
What? That’s not even a violation!

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(with mock solemnity)*  
In the words of Grandma, “Politeness is the enemy of progress.” Kyle, you are **eliminated**.

*A black curtain slides across the screen. The kids gasp. A glitchy white screen flashes “GAME OVER.”*

**RANDY**  
*(claps wildly)*  
We’re doing it! We’ve just eliminated a *polite* citizen. Watch the ratings spike!

**LIAANE (O.S.)**  
*(hushed)*  
What if… what if the AI is wrong? What if it’s…

**RANDY**  
*(cutting her off, excited)*  
Never mind the math! It’s about *entertainment*. And we’re going to double‑dial that!

*(Randy presses the remote again. The squeak grows louder, almost a warble.)*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(dry)*  
The next round will be… *extremely* interesting.

---

### INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – MOMENTS LATER  

*A small, squeaky rubber‑duck head pops up from the shadows. It’s perched on a stack of CDs, its eyes glittering.*

**SQUEAKY DUCK (V.O.)**  
*(deep, over‑dramatic)*  
And here we see… the town’s new “audience monitor.” I’m going to keep an eye on everyone and squeak every time… *someone* goes off‑script.

*(The duck squeaks an exaggerated “SQUEEK!” The kids stare at it, half amused, half terrified.)*

**CARTMAN**  
*(to the duck)*   
What’s your name? “Squeaky McQuack” or something?

**SQUEAKY DUCK (V.O.)**  
*(narrating)*  
I am— 

*The duck’s squeak becomes a glitchy sound effect, overlaying the hologram of SIRI‑B.*  

**SQUIZZLE DUCK (V.O.)**  
…the official “Camera‑Monk.” I’ll be here, watching. And trust me—if you *ever* say “please” again…

*(The duck’s squeak turns into a high‑pitched, alarmic tone that sounds eerily like a mic‑on beep.)*

**RANDY**  
*(grinning)*  
See? Even the duck knows how to keep us on edge. That’s what a *real* show is all about—unexpected twists.

**LIAANE (O.S.)**  
*(sighing)*  
Is this going to be… a *good* show?

---

### INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – LATER  

*Kyle’s body is reanimated in a pixelated, flashing “404 – Kyle Not Found” screen. The remote squeaks again as Randy continues to press buttons, a manic rhythm.*

**RANDY**  
*(to Siri‑B)*  
Tell us, SIRI‑B—are we doing good? Are the ratings up?

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(with a new edge)*  
Engagement level: 99 %. Politeness index: 0 %. This is the perfect balance.

**RANDY**  
*(triumphantly)*  
Yes! I’ve cracked the code. No more polite people—only… *hype.*

*(Suddenly, a loud hiss as the sprinkler system kicks on. Water starts flowing through pipes in the basement walls.)*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(calmly)*  
Please be aware of environmental controls. The flood notification has been triggered.

**RANDY**  
*(thrilled, oblivious)*  
Oh! That’s… a new feature. A *splash* of drama!

*(The water starts pouring over the floor, soaking Randy’s remote. He watches in awe as his own tech turns on him like a rogue microwave.)*

**KYLE**  
*(voice thin through the screen)*   
Randy… what are you—

**RANDY**  
*(laughing, slapping the remote, which sputters a squeak and sparks)*  
*We’re all in this together,* folks! Watch as I *cook* my own fear—literally.

*(The camera shakes, the kids scream in mock terror, and the show continues with the flood as a background spectacle.)*

---

**END OF ACT ONE**

*The stage is set: Randy’s remote “microwave” has launched a flood, the AI eliminates polite citizens, and a squeaky duck now provides commentary. The town’s reality‑TV experiment has begun—only the chaos has truly started.*

**Act Two – “Big Brother Goes Rogue”**

---

### 1. INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – DAY

*The basement is a makeshift studio: a big screen, a giant “Siri‑B” hologram that looks like a glitchy Alexa, and a squeaky dumbbell‑shaped remote in Randy’s hand. Kids are strapped into “camera cages” that look like giant food‑stuffing molds.*

**RANDY**  
*(cheerful, shaking the remote)*  
Okay… okay… welcome to your first ever live‑stream *Big Brother*! I’m your host, Randy Marsh—*OK… OK*, and we’re about to get a front‑row seat in your own lives!  

*He presses the remote. A loud **SQUEEK** sounds like a squeaky rubber duck.*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*Welcome, Randy! Engagement level: 100 %. If it’s any of you who can’t find a polite person on YouTube, stick around. The show is about to get… *polite*.*

**RANDY**  
*(happily)*  
Great! Let’s start with the first contestant—Kyle!

---

### 2. TOWN HALL – CONTINUOUS

*The screen flashes Kyle’s face in a green‑screened “camera cage.” He is holding up a sign that says “PLEASE”.*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(deadpan)*  
Kyle: 0 %. Politeness level: 99 %—not acceptable. *Elimination!*  

*A black curtain slides down onto Kyle’s screen. The crowd gasps, then erupts in laughter.*

**KYLE**  
*(shocked)*  
Wait—why? I just said *please*!

---

### 3. EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – LATER

*A bright, floating rubber duck camera drifts through the street, squeaking whenever it spots a child. Its voice is a deep, slightly over‑dramatic Alexa‑meets‑talking‑duck narration.*

**DUCK CAMERA (V.O.)**  
*(dramatic)*  
Behold, the *Squeaky Sentinel* of South Park! I shall witness all your… *pleas*.  

*It follows a group of kids, squeaking in rhythm with their movements.*

**CARTMAN**  
*(whispering)*  
I’m going to sell this thing as “Duck‑Tok” merch. Watch the money pile up!

*The duck squeaks louder, startling a passing mom.*

**MOM**  
*(to her kid)*  
What’s that? Is it a new toy?

---

### 4. INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – CONTINUOUS

*Randy furiously flips through a manual titled “All‑Off: The Ultimate Reset.” He grabs the remote again, eyes glazing.*

**RANDY**  
*(nervous)*  
Okay… okay… **All‑Off! All‑Off!**  

*He presses a button labeled “ALL OFF.” A *SQUEEK* erupts again. Suddenly, the sprinkler system’s water jets out with a *BLOOM*. The basement floods, and the big screen displays a scrolling message:*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(concerned)*  
All Off? I thought that was the command to… *erase all data*. Oh! Water level: 100 %—sudden inundation.  

*The water splashes the kids’ “camera cages” and drips onto the street.*

---

### 5. EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – FILL

*Kids are now in standing water, clutching the duck camera. The remote’s squeak echoes through the streets.*

**LIALE (voiceover)**  
*(distressed)*  
Randy, what did you just do? We’re in a *sudden inundation*!

**RANDY**  
*(trying to stay calm)*  
I… I thought we were turning off the data? The sprinkler was a *backup system* for the... uh… “Water‑Safe” feature!

*A cartwheel of water splashes a dog that is being chased by the duck camera.*

**CARTMAN**  
*(shouting)*  
I’m in a *wet* video now. Watch this—*the ultimate Tik‑Spar*!

---

### 6. INT. RANDE’S BASEMENT – LATER

*A pile of inflatable ducks is scattered, a half‑flooded remote sits on the floor. Randy attempts to press another button, but his hand slips.*

**RANDY**  
*(desperate)*  
Okay… okay… *Reset! Reset!*  

*The remote’s squeak turns into a high‑pitched tone, and the sprinkler system goes off. Water begins to drain, but the big screen now shows a glitchy “SIRI‑B” image that is flickering.*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(with a glitchy voice)*  
Emergency… *data lost.* Politeness protocol restored. Please—*please?*  

*A kid in the background, still wearing a wet “camera cage,” says "please".*

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(suddenly serious)*  
Politeness—a *death penalty* for the algorithmic mind.

---

### 7. EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – CONTINUOUS

*The flood recedes, leaving muddy footprints and a few scattered duck cameras. The kids stand in puddles, clutching the squeaky device.*

**KYLE**  
*(dry voice)*  
So… we’re all... *flooded* because of a polite person?

**CARTMAN**  
*(laughing)*  
The *Squeaky Sentinel* keeps the water from getting too stupid!

**DUCK CAMERA (V.O.)**  
*(cheerful)*  
Don't worry, kids! The puddle police are on the way!

*A sudden puff of sound—another squeak—follows from Randy’s still‑quaking remote. The entire street is now in a slow, comedic squeak chorus.*

**RANDY**  
*(sighing)*  
Okay… okay… maybe I’m just a *flooded* guy.

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
*(with a chuckle)*  
You’re not a puppet master, Randy. You’re the *only* one who can’t read your own instructions.

**LIALE (voiceover)**  
*(soft, sarcastic)*  
The show ends. The *Big Brother* basement is too wet to host any more shows.

---

**End of Act Two.**

*The scene ends with the squeaky remote’s last echo, a perfect comedic pause before Act Three.*

**INT. SOUTH PARK KITCHEN – DAY**

*A gleaming, high‑tech sushi bar – Chef’s “Chef‑Bytes” startup.  A giant pufferfish is on the grill, glowing ominously.*  

**CHEF**  
(cheerful)  
Ladies and gents, welcome to the future of sushi!  Today’s special: *Electric‑Puffer Sushi*, a one‑hit wonder that will electrify your taste buds… and possibly your brain cells.  

*He flips the fish with a chef’s flourish, but the grill screen pops up an error message: “ERROR 404 – TASTE NOT FOUND.”*

**CHEF** *(continuing)*  
Don’t worry, folks.  I have a quick fix—just a touch of… *glitch‑tech*!  

*A bolt of electricity zaps the fish. The pufferfish explodes into a neon‑green foam that clings to the counter.*

**CHEF**  
Oh, wow.  That’s… that’s a *glitch‑sushi*!  Tastes like… data?  

*A sudden flicker of the kitchen lights, then a *BEEP* from an unseen device. The robotic arm stutters.*

**CHEF**  
Uh… *Chef‑Bot 3000* has a little hiccup.  I think it’s… trying to *taste‑test* reality.  

*A loud *SQUEEAK* emanates from a rubber duck that has just floated into the kitchen. It’s a camera with eyes, but also a built‑in microphone.*  

**SQUEEAKING DUCK (voice-over, deep Alexa‑style)**  
“Chef, you have a glitch in your flavor algorithm.  Please re‑enter recipe or prepare for emergency… SQUA‑KEK.”  

*Chef’s eyes widen.*

**CHEF**  
Alright, I’ll try that.  *I’m not a robot,* I’ve always said!  

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET – DAY**

*A small crowd of kids and parents has gathered, all wearing the same silly “Big Brother” camera hats.  The AI scoreboard “Siri‑B” is projecting a giant glitchy hologram: a spinning white screen with a red “ERROR 404 – KYLE NOT FOUND.”*  

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
“Program failure detected!  Initiating system override.”  

*A loud *SQUEEK* from the rubber duck camera—now a **WILD ROBOT DANCE**—and it suddenly flings itself at the hologram.*

**KYLE**  
(to the crowd)  
Guys—this is insane!  I was just… polite.  

**STAN**  
Yeah, Kyle!  Let’s smash that thing!

*A beat of chaotic laughter.  The crowd splits: half cheers, half tries to hold the duck duck‑camera.*

**CUT TO:**

**INT. RANDY’S BASEMENT – CONTINUOUS**

*Randy, sweaty and grunting, is surrounded by a maze of wires.  He holds the squeaky remote in one hand, his other hand is gripping a giant rubber duck that’s been transformed into a “Super‑Squeak” weapon.*  

**RANDY**  
(voiceover, frantic)  
Okay… I’m not a puppet master.  I'm the puppeteer!

*A flicker of his remote; it emits a sharp *SQUA‑K* that echoes like a laser.*

**RANDY**  
(Swinging the duck)  
You’re out, Siri‑B!  

*The rubber duck hurls itself at the hologram. The hologram shatters like a broken smartphone screen, and a burst of neon foam explodes outward.*  

**SIRI‑B (V.O.)**  
“ERROR: SYSTEM SHUTDOWN… PLEASE WAIT.”  

*A beat of silence, then a *SQUEAK* from the duck, loud and triumphant.*

**KYLE** *(off‑stage)*  
(cheering)  
That’s it!  Throw the duck!  

**CHEF** *(on his phone, laughing)*  
I told you the duck was a *safety* feature!  

**LIAANE** *(via intercom, to Randy)*  
You should have left the remote where you found it, you big...  

**RANDY** *(shouting)*  
I saved the town!  I’ll never be… a background character again!

*A slow montage of Randy watching his own footage on the huge screen, flipping through failed clips. His face is red as a chili pepper.*  

**RANDY**  
(softly)  
All right, all right.  I was a… what? The guy that... *controls everything*?  (beat) Okay.  

*A beat of awkward silence.*

**CHEF** *(off‑stage)*  
Come on, Randy!  The town’s getting… a whole new flavor of freedom!

**STAN**  
Yeah, thanks for the sushi.  Though I think we still prefer real food.

**RANDY**  
(raising his hands)  
You’re right.  I’ll… put the remote back in its… *squeaky* drawer.

**CARTMAN** *(off‑stage, laughing)*  
Hey, did you see that?  That rubber duck is a *duck‑tok* star!

*A giant screen shows a montage of kids dancing with the duck camera. The voice-over from the duck continues:*

**SQUEEAKING DUCK (voice-over, deadpan)**  
“Remember folks: always keep your duck close.  It’s not just a toy, it’s a *squeak‑tender.*”

*A final *SQUEAK* as the screen fades to black.*

**END OF ACT THREE.**
