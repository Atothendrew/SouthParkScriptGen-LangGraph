# Part 2 Prompt\n\nContinuing from the previous part: In this over‑the‑top South Park episode, Randy Marsh launches a town‑wide “Big Brother” reality show that turns every house into a live‑streamed experiment. With his basement control center (complete with a squeaky dumbbell “remote” and an obnoxious AI scoreboard called Siri‑B), Randy keeps the kids strapped to cameras while the town watches—and gets a few surprises, like an accidental sprinkler apocalypse and a rogue rubber‑duck‑headed camera. As the AI starts eliminating contestants (Kyle gets kicked out for being too polite), chaos erupts, Chef’s pufferfish sushi turns into a cyber‑food nightmare, and Randy finally realizes that the real power lies not in controlling everyone but in letting the absurdity of being watched unfold. The episode ends with Randy stepping back from his “big brother” ego, the town embracing their own chaotic freedom, and a final gag of a squeaky duck echoing through the streets. The tone remains irreverent, satirical, and character‑driven, true to South Park’s brand of absurd social commentary.\n\nUnresolved plotlines to address: Unresolved plotline detected\n\n## Continuity Context\n\n**Part 2 of 10**\n\n**Original Prompt:** The next season of Big Brother happens inside of southpark and is comprised of south park characters\n\n**Previous Parts:**\n- Part 1: In this over‑the‑top South Park episode, Randy Marsh launches a town‑wide “Big Brother” reality show that turns every house into a live‑streamed experiment.
