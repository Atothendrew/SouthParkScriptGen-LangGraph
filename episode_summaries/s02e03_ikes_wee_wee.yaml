plot:
  logline: Kyle tries to save his little brother Ike from circumcision while Mr. Garrison
    deals with being fired and replaced by Ms. Choksondik.
  plot_summary: 'When Kyle learns that his baby brother Ike is scheduled for circumcision,
    he becomes convinced that his parents are planning to cut off Ike''s penis entirely.
    Horrified by this misunderstanding, Kyle decides he must save Ike from what he
    perceives as mutilation. He enlists the help of Stan, Kenny, and reluctantly Cartman
    to help hide Ike from his parents.


    Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison is fired from his teaching position for inappropriate
    behavior and is replaced by the stern Ms. Choksondik. Garrison struggles with
    unemployment and eventually takes a job at a museum, where he begins to question
    his identity and sexuality. His puppet Mr. Hat also goes through changes as Garrison''s
    psychological state shifts.


    The episode explores themes of cultural and religious traditions, misunderstanding,
    and growing up. Kyle''s protective instincts toward Ike drive the main plot, while
    Garrison''s subplot introduces questions about identity and change. The resolution
    comes when Kyle finally understands what circumcision actually is, though he still
    questions the necessity of the procedure.
