  plot_summary: 'South Park becomes the host of an independent film festival, attracting
    a flood of pretentious filmmakers, self-important celebrities, and pseudo-intellectual
    film enthusiasts to the small mountain town. The festival brings chaos as the
    town is overrun with people who look down on the locals while claiming to celebrate
    "authentic" independent cinema.


    Meanwhile, Chef capitalizes on the festival by selling his "Chocolate Salty Balls,"
    a popular snack that becomes a hit with the festival-goers. However, the massive
    influx of people creates serious environmental problems, including pollution and
    overcrowding that threatens the local ecosystem and the town''s infrastructure.


    The episode satirizes the pretentiousness of independent film culture, celebrity
    activism, and environmental hypocrisy. The boys witness the transformation of
    their town and the clash between local values and outside cultural influences.
    The resolution involves the town dealing with both the cultural invasion and the
    environmental consequences of hosting such a large event.
