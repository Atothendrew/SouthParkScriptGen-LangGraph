  plot_summary: |
    When Cartman wins a national essay contest with his piece "Save the Rainforest," he becomes an instant celebrity and is invited to appear on television. The attention goes to his head, and he begins using Weight Gain 4000 to bulk up for his TV appearance, not realizing it's making him extremely fat rather than muscular.

    Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison harbors a deep resentment toward Kathie Lee Gifford, who is coming to South Park to present Cartman with his award. Along with his hand puppet Mr. Hat, Garrison plots to assassinate Gifford during the ceremony. The boys become suspicious of Garrison's behavior and try to stop him.

    The episode culminates at the award ceremony where Garrison's assassination attempt fails spectacularly, Cartman's obesity becomes apparent, and the town's excitement over their celebrity visitor leads to chaos. The episode establishes early themes about fame, vanity, and the absurdity of small-town celebrity worship.
