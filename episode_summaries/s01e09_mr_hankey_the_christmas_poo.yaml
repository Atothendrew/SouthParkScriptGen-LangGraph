  plot_summary: Kyle feels left out during Christmas as the only Jewish kid in South
    Park, while Stan befriends Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces who embodies the
    Christmas spirit, though no one else can see him. The town removes all religious
    elements from their Christmas play to avoid offending anyone, resulting in a bland,
    meaningless production that satisfies no one. Mr. Hankey appears to everyone during
    the Christmas pageant, teaching the town that Christmas can include everyone regardless
    of their beliefs, and Kyle learns he can enjoy Christmas without compromising
