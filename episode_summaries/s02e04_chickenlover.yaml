  title: Chickenlover
  original_air_date: '1998-05-27'
  episode_type: standalone
plot:
  logline: Officer Barbrady learns to read to solve a case involving someone having
    sex with chickens, while the boys deal with Cartman's newfound authority as a
    deputy.
  plot_summary: 'When a mysterious person begins having sexual relations with chickens
    around South Park, Officer Barbrady is assigned to investigate. However, his illiteracy
    becomes a major obstacle in solving the case, as he cannot read the evidence or
    witness statements. The town realizes that their police officer cannot read and
    demands he learn immediately.


    Meanwhile, Barbrady deputizes Cartman to help with law enforcement while he attends
    reading classes. Cartman immediately abuses his new authority, becoming a tyrannical
    enforcer who terrorizes the townspeople with excessive citations and arrests.
    His power trip escalates as he begins to see himself as the ultimate authority
    in South Park.


    The episode follows two parallel storylines: Barbrady''s struggle to learn reading
    with the help of a children''s book called "The Pony Express," and Cartman''s
    descent into authoritarianism. The climax comes when Barbrady must use his newly
    acquired reading skills to solve the chicken lover case, while the town must deal
    with Cartman''s abuse of power. The resolution reveals the identity of the chicken
    lover and restores order to South Park.
