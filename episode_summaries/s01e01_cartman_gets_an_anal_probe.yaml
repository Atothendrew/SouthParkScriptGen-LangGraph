  title: "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"
  original_air_date: "1997-08-13"
  episode_type: "standalone"

plot:
  logline: "The boys encounter aliens while waiting for the school bus, leading to Cartman's abduction and Kyle's brother Ike being taken by visitors."
  plot_summary: |
    The very first South Park episode introduces us to Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick as they wait for the school bus. When Cartman claims he was visited by aliens who gave him an anal probe, the other boys dismiss it as another one of his lies. However, strange things begin happening around town, including cattle mutilations and UFO sightings.

    The situation escalates when Kyle's Canadian adopted brother Ike is taken by the visitors (aliens), leading to a frantic rescue mission. The boys discover that the aliens are indeed real and have been conducting experiments on the townspeople. In typical South Park fashion, the episode combines crude humor with social commentary about alien abduction stories and conspiracy theories.

    The episode culminates in a confrontation with the aliens at the school, where the boys must work together to save Ike and stop the alien invasion. The resolution establishes the show's pattern of ordinary kids dealing with extraordinary situations in their small Colorado town.
