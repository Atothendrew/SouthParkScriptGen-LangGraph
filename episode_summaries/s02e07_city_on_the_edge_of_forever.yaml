plot:
  logline: The boys get trapped on a school bus hanging over a cliff and tell stories
    to pass time, while Ms. Crabtree searches for them with increasingly bizarre encounters.
  plot_summary: 'During a school field trip, the boys'' bus crashes and ends up precariously
    balanced on the edge of a cliff. Trapped inside with no immediate rescue in sight,
    the children begin telling stories to keep their spirits up and pass the time.
    Each story becomes increasingly outlandish and reflects the personality of its
    teller, ranging from adventure tales to completely absurd scenarios.


    Meanwhile, Ms. Crabtree, the bus driver who was thrown from the vehicle during
    the crash, embarks on a surreal journey to find help. Her quest leads her through
    a series of bizarre encounters and situations that become progressively more disconnected
    from reality. The episode plays with narrative structure and storytelling conventions.


    The episode serves as both a parody of anthology storytelling and a commentary
    on how people cope with crisis through imagination and narrative. The stories
    within stories create multiple layers of reality, with each tale revealing something
    about the character telling it. The resolution brings together the various narrative
    threads in typical South Park fashion, questioning the nature of reality and storytelling
    itself.
