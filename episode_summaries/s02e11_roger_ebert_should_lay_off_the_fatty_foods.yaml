plot:
  logline: The boys become film critics after their negative review goes viral, while
    Cartman deals with being replaced by a new kid at school.
  plot_summary: 'When the boys attend a terrible movie and write a scathing review
    for the school newspaper, their critique becomes unexpectedly popular and launches
    them into the world of film criticism. They begin reviewing movies with increasingly
    harsh and pretentious commentary, eventually gaining national attention and appearing
    on television shows.


    Meanwhile, a new student arrives at South Park Elementary who seems to be everything
    Cartman is not - polite, well-behaved, and liked by everyone. This new kid threatens
    Cartman''s position in the group dynamic and his sense of self-importance, leading
    to jealousy and schemes to undermine the newcomer.


    The episode satirizes film criticism, media culture, and the way children can
    become caught up in adult worlds they don''t fully understand. The boys'' journey
    into criticism reveals how easy it is to become pretentious and lose sight of
    genuine enjoyment, while Cartman''s subplot explores themes of insecurity and
    the fear of being replaced.
