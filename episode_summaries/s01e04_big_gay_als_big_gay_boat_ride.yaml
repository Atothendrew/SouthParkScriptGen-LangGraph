  episode_type: "standalone"

plot:
  logline: "Stan's dog Sparky is revealed to be gay, leading Stan to Big Gay Al's sanctuary, while the boys' football team faces their rivals."
  plot_summary: |
    When Stan's dog Sparky displays homosexual behavior, Stan becomes confused and embarrassed, not knowing how to handle the situation. The other boys, particularly Cartman, mock Stan about having a "gay dog." Stan's discomfort with Sparky's sexuality leads him to reject his pet, causing Sparky to run away.

    Sparky ends up at Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, a refuge for homosexual animals run by the flamboyantly gay Big Gay Al. When Stan goes to retrieve Sparky, Big Gay Al takes him on a boat ride through the sanctuary, educating Stan about homosexuality and acceptance. Through various musical numbers and explanations, Al helps Stan understand that being gay is natural and that love comes in many forms.

    Meanwhile, the South Park Cows football team, coached by Chef, prepares for a big game against their rivals. The team struggles without their mascot Sparky, and the game becomes a backdrop for Stan's journey of acceptance. The episode culminates with Stan learning to accept Sparky for who he is, and the town learning about tolerance and understanding.
