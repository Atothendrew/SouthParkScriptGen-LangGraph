  plot_summary: Stan's grandfather repeatedly asks Stan to kill him because he's tired
    of living, while the boys become obsessed with the violent TV show 'Terrance and
    Phillip' despite parental opposition. The parents of South Park, led by Sheila
    Broflovski, campaign against Terrance and Phillip for corrupting their children
    with crude humor and violence. Death arrives to take Grandpa Marsh but is distracted
    by Terrance and Phillip, finding the show hilarious. The parents' protest backfires
    when they realize they're being hypocritical.
