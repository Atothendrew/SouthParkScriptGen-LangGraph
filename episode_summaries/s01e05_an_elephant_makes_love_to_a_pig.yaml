  title: An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig
  original_air_date: '1997-09-10'
  episode_type: standalone
plot:
  logline: Kyle's elephant and Cartman's pig are bred together for a science fair
    project, while Stan deals with his sister Shelley's bullying.
  plot_summary: 'For the South Park Elementary science fair, Kyle decides to crossbreed
    his pet elephant with Cartman''s pig to create a new hybrid animal. The boys believe
    this will win them first place and make them rich and famous. However, the genetic
    experiment proves more complicated than expected, leading to unexpected and chaotic
    results.


    Meanwhile, Stan struggles with his older sister Shelley, who constantly bullies
    and torments him. Shelley''s aggressive behavior escalates throughout the episode,
    making Stan''s home life miserable. The family dynamics become strained as Stan
    tries to deal with his sister''s abuse while his parents seem oblivious to the
    severity of the situation.


    The episode explores themes of scientific ethics, sibling rivalry, and the consequences
    of playing with nature. As the science fair approaches, the boys'' experiment
    spirals out of control, while Stan''s family issues reach a breaking point. The
    two storylines intersect as the chaos from both situations converges at the science
    fair.
