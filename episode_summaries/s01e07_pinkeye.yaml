  plot_summary: A zombie outbreak occurs in South Park on Halloween when Kenny dies
    and is accidentally embalmed with Worcestershire sauce instead of formaldehyde,
    causing him to rise from the dead and bite others, turning them into zombies.
    The boys are excited about Halloween and trick-or-treating, with Cartman dressing
    as Hitler (thinking he's a ghost) while the adults initially mistake the zombie
    outbreak for pinkeye. Chef and the boys discover that killing the original zombie
    (Kenny) will cure everyone. They chainsaw Kenny in half, ending the outbreak and
    returning everyone to normal.
