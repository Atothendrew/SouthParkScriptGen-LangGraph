  logline: The long-awaited revelation of Cartman's father is finally revealed, while
    a natural disaster threatens South Park.
  plot_summary: 'Following the cliffhanger from Season 1''s finale, this episode finally
    reveals the identity of Cartman''s father. However, the revelation is complicated
    by a massive blizzard that traps the town and cuts off all communication. Dr.
    Mephesto, who has the DNA test results, is shot by an unknown assailant before
    he can reveal the truth.


    While the adults deal with the crisis and try to save Dr. Mephesto''s life, the
    boys are stuck at the community center during the storm. The episode builds tension
    around multiple mysteries: who shot Dr. Mephesto, who is Cartman''s father, and
    how will the town survive the natural disaster.


    The climax reveals that Cartman''s mother Liane is actually intersex and is technically
    Cartman''s father, while his biological father remains unknown. This shocking
    twist subverts audience expectations and adds another layer to the show''s willingness
    to push boundaries. The episode also resolves the immediate crisis with Dr. Mephesto''s
    recovery and the town''s survival of the blizzard.
