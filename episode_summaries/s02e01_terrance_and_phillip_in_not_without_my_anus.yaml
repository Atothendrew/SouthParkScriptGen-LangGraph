plot:
  logline: An April Fool's Day special featuring Terrance and Phillip as they try
    to save Canada from Saddam Hussein's evil plot.
  plot_summary: 'In this controversial April Fool''s Day episode that aired instead
    of the anticipated Cartman''s father reveal, viewers are treated to a full Terrance
    and Phillip adventure. The Canadian comedy duo discovers that Saddam Hussein has
    taken over Canada and is planning to use it as a base for world domination.


    Terrance is captured by Saddam''s forces while Phillip escapes to gather help.
    The episode follows Phillip''s quest to rescue his comedy partner and save Canada
    from the dictator''s evil schemes. Along the way, they encounter various Canadian
    stereotypes and engage in their trademark crude humor and excessive flatulence.


    The episode culminates in a showdown between the comedy duo and Saddam Hussein,
    with the fate of Canada hanging in the balance. True to Terrance and Phillip''s
    style, the resolution involves elaborate fart jokes and slapstick comedy, ultimately
    saving Canada through the power of Canadian comedy.
