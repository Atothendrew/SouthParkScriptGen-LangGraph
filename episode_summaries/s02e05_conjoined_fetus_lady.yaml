plot:
  logline: The boys' dodgeball team advances to the championships while dealing with
    prejudice against the school nurse who has a conjoined fetus on her head.
  plot_summary: 'South Park Elementary''s dodgeball team, led by the boys, unexpectedly
    advances through regional championships toward the state finals. However, their
    success is overshadowed by the town''s cruel treatment of the school nurse, who
    has a conjoined fetus attached to her head. The townspeople mock and fear her,
    calling her names and treating her as a freak.


    As the boys continue their winning streak in dodgeball, they begin to understand
    the unfairness of how the nurse is treated. The episode explores themes of prejudice,
    acceptance, and what it means to be different. The nurse, despite being competent
    and kind, faces constant discrimination and isolation from the community.


    The climax comes during the state championship game, where the boys must decide
    whether to continue playing or take a stand against the prejudice they''ve witnessed.
    The episode addresses disability rights, social acceptance, and the harm caused
    by treating people as objects of curiosity rather than as human beings. The resolution
    shows the boys learning about tolerance and the importance of treating everyone
    with dignity.
