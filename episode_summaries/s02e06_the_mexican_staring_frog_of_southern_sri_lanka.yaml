plot:
  logline: The boys create a fake documentary about a mythical creature to win a contest,
    while Jesus and Satan prepare for their boxing match.
  plot_summary: 'When the boys learn about a documentary contest with a cash prize,
    they decide to create their own film. However, lacking any real subject matter,
    they fabricate a story about the "Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,"
    a completely fictional creature they claim to have discovered. Their fake documentary
    includes staged interviews, manipulated footage, and elaborate lies about the
    creature''s behavior and habitat.


    Meanwhile, Jesus Christ and Satan are preparing for their highly anticipated boxing
    match, which has captured the attention of the entire town. The fight becomes
    a major betting event, with residents placing wagers on the outcome. The boys''
    documentary subplot intersects with the boxing storyline as both events build
    toward their respective climaxes.


    The episode explores themes of deception, media manipulation, and the gullibility
    of audiences. The boys'' fake documentary succeeds beyond their expectations,
    raising questions about truth in media and the ease with which people can be fooled
    by convincing presentations. The resolution brings together both storylines in
    typical South Park fashion, with unexpected consequences for everyone involved.
