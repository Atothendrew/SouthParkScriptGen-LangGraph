  title: "Volcano"
  original_air_date: "1997-08-27"
  episode_type: "standalone"

plot:
  logline: "The boys go hunting with Stan's Uncle Jimbo and Ned, while a volcano threatens to destroy South Park."
  plot_summary: |
    Stan's Uncle Jimbo takes the boys on a hunting trip to teach them about guns and hunting. Jimbo and his war buddy Ned demonstrate their approach to hunting, which involves yelling "It's coming right for us!" before shooting any animal to justify self-defense. The boys are initially reluctant participants, especially Stan who is uncomfortable with killing animals.

    Meanwhile, a volcano near South Park becomes active and threatens to erupt, putting the entire town in danger. The townspeople panic and argue about what to do, with some wanting to evacuate and others wanting to stay and fight the natural disaster. The mayor proves ineffective in handling the crisis.

    The two storylines converge when the hunting party encounters the volcanic threat. In typical South Park fashion, the episode combines outdoor adventure with natural disaster, while exploring themes of gun culture, environmental threats, and small-town crisis management. The episode also introduces several recurring characters and establishes the show's approach to controversial topics.
